# Welcome to the UT Dallas WeTeach_CS Collaborative!

The first two weeks of class will be taking care of paperwork, getting everyone
in the online systems, and, for CS content, discussing computational thinking.

Please spend some time exploring the website! If you run into any problems
with the website please [let Georgia know](mailto:georgia.stuart@utdallas.edu).

Each week, there will be an overview of the module, and a [checklist of
tasks](todo) to complete as the first two things in the module sidebar.
**At this time, the module sidebar does not function correctly on screens
smaller than an iPad! We're working on fixing this.**

The content and assignment pages are listed under the sidebar.

All class discussion and communication (with the exception of grades) will
be on [Slack](https://utdweteachcs.slack.com/).
