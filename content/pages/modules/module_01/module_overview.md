# Time to program!

This week we'll dive into programming! Instead of programming in the
traditional manner using a text editor, however, we'll use block-based,
visual tools to begin.

## Tools for this module

This module will use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and
[trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) to introduce

- variables
- truth values
- if-else statements
- operations

Please note that making an account on either of these services is not
required.

## In class

This week in class we'll use block-based programming to interact with
the TI-Nspire and Innovator Hub! You will need a non-chromebook computer
for this to install the teacher software on. Please let Georgia know if
you need to borrow one for class.

Remember that you're welcome to attend both days of class if you would like
to revisit the in-class activity or simply work on your weekly assignments
with the instructional team on hand.
