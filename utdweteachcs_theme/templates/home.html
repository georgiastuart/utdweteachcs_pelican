            <h2>Texas teachers learn computer science!</h2>
            <p>Texas is facing a critical shortage of computer science teachers. If you are a certified 6-12 math
                or science teacher, this FREE two-part course will prepare you to take the 8-12 Computer Science
                exam and successfully transition from your current subject to the Computer Science classroom or
                incorporate CS into your current math or science classes.</p>
            <p class="lead">Unfortunately, we are full for the Spring-Summer 2017 program. If you would like to be
                notified
