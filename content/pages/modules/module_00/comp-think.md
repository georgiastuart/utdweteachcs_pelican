## What is Computational Thinking?

Computer science is not just about programming, it's also about learning
to think *computationally*. The ISTE,
[International Society for Technology in Education](http://iste.org){: target="_blank" },
 has defined an operational definition for computational thinking.

While computational thinking has been on education the scene since the 1980s,
the prevalence of computers in the new millenium. Your reading assignment
for this week is two papers--the seminal Jeannette Wing paper from 2006, and
an overview of the field six years later.
