## Tools for this module

In this module, we'll be practicing the skills learned in modules 1 and 2
using [trinket.io](https://trinket.io)

## In class

This week in class we'll again use block-based programming to interact with
the TI-Nspire and Innovator Hub! Bring the laptop you installed the
 TI Nspire teacher software on. Please let Georgia know if
you need to borrow one for class.

Remember that you're welcome to attend both days of class if you would like
to revisit the in-class activity or simply work on your weekly assignments
with the instructional team on hand.
