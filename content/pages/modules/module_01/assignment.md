# Module 01 Assignment

For assignments, remember that we use standards-based grading. This means
you should demonstrate the extent of your knowledge as best you can. If you
do not meet a standard the first time (and it will be expected that you'll
spend some time in partially proficient before achieving full proficiency),
there will be future opportunities to demonstrate improvement.
