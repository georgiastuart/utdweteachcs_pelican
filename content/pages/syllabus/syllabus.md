## Course Description

With the addition of the Computer Science track in the STEM Endorsement
and the requirement that districts offer Computer Science and make it available
to all students, computer science certified teachers are in high demand.
This course series is intended to prepare Texas teachers to take the 8–12
Computer Science Test (241) and teach computer science or integrate computer
science principles within their current math or science classroom. The two
courses cover everything outlined in the TExES Computer Science 241 standards
for Domain II - Program Design and Development and Domain III - Programming
Language Topics. In addition, we cover as much as possible of Domain IV -
Special Topics. We also focus on the TEKS for Computer Science I and II and
the standards for AP Computer Science Principles. This course is **not** effective
preparation for AP Computer Science A..


## Requirements

Students are expected to be comfortable using a computer and typing. Consistent
Internet access is required as much of the course is online. Students must
be comfortable with middle school level math, including basic algebraic
manipulation and the coordinate plane.


## Course Format

Introduction to Computer Science for Teachers is a two-course series comprising
two eight week, three credit hour courses. Each course provides 45 contact
hours and is taught with a blended model—there is significant online instruction
and interaction. In addition, attendance at one of the two in-person sessions per
week is required (though you are welcome to attend both to receive more in-person assistance).


## Course Tools

We use TI-Nspire Handhelds, teacher software, and Innovator Hubs to explore
programming through TI-Basic and Lua and computers to write Lua and JavaScript.
Course communication and discussion will be done through the course Slack.
Note: you are not required to use your real name on Slack, but you must inform
the instructor of your screen name. All grades will be posted on the university eLearning.

## Student Objectives

*Students will be able to...*

- discuss computational and algorithmic thinking, the current research, and how these modes of thinking appear frequently in our day-to-day lives
- describe variables, control structures, truth values, and integer operations and use them in a variety of programming contexts
- create a simple game
- describe data types, floating point operations, binary arithmetic, and data structures and use them in a variety of programming contexts.
- use abstraction to create flexible functions and discuss the importance of abstraction in programming
- create a program that can interact with the physical world via a variety of sensors
- describe the merits of and use design strategies, diagramming, pseudocode, version control, and IDEs

## Course Grading and Hour Completion # { #grading }

Evaluation for this course will be done on two axes: hour completion for TRC credit and a standards-based grade scale for academic credit.

#### Hour Completion

This course awards a maximum of 45 hours for TRC participation. Students have the opportunity to earn up to six
hours for each of the eight weeks, split between in-class participation (3 hours) and online participation
(3 hours). Participation is monitored by comprehension checks after students view course material, weekly
assignments, and participation in the class Slack. Missing an in-class meeting or online assignments will
result in a reduction of earned hours for the week unless alternative arrangements are made with the instructor
in advance.

#### Standards-Based Grading

Since the aim of the course is preparation for the TExES 241 Computer Science exam, we will employ standards-based
grading aligned with the TExES Computer Science 241 Educator standards. Translation to the A-F scale used at
UT Dallas is as follows. *Note: “proficient on all standards” and similar phrasing means “at least proficient on
all standards.” Higher proficiencies are included.*

## Assignment resubmission

Since our goal is to assess mastery of standards, students will be given the opportunity to either resubmit
assignments with correction and discussion of the errors and/or to submit another, similar assignment.
Specifics of the resubmission or similar assignment are at the instructor’s discretion. Students wishing to
re-submit work must consult with the instructor.
