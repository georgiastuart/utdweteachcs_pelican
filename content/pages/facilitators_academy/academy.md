## Program Overview # { #overview }

The WeTeach_CS facilitators academy at UT Dallas will give you the tools
to run a one to two week summer institute with your WeTeach_CS collaborative.
The theme of the Facilitators Academy is “Computational Thinking” and
contains explorations of computational thinking across the curriculum
throughout the week. Our program is designed in Scratch and Python, but
the computer science and computational thinking activities and concepts
can be easily translated to other languages if you would like to use
something else with your Collaborative.

At the facilitators academy, you will participate in all the activities
of the summer institute, with added consideration on how to replicate
the program for your teachers. You will receive a facilitator's guide in
addition to digital participant packs. The facilitator's guide leads you
through how to prepare for and execute each activity, along with an overview
of the subject matter. The participant packs contain extension lesson plans
for each activity suitable for a K-12 classroom, concept information, and
completed python programs as well as accompanying skeleton templates.

We will demonstrate a variety of technologies that the institute can
incorporate, depending on what you have available. All the provided
activities can either be done offline on traditional computers running Windows,
macOS, or Linux; or online on Chromebooks using the free online services
trinket.io or repl.it. You'll be given instructions on how to get everyone
up and running in a BYOD situation. In addition, we have incorporated a
variety of “unplugged” activities to learn computational thinking and
computer science without the use of computers at all!
