    Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving process that includes (but is not limited to)
    the following characteristics:

    <ul>
        <li>Formulating problems in a way that enables us to use a computer and other tools to help solve them.</li>
        <li>Logically organizing and analyzing data</li>
        <li>Representing data through abstractions such as models and simulations</li>
        <li>Automating solutions through algorithmic thinking (a series of ordered steps)</li>
        <li>Identifying, analyzing, and implementing possible solutions with the goal of achieving the most
            efficient and effective combination of steps and resources
        </li>
        <li>Generalizing and transferring this problem solving process to a wide variety of problems</li>
    </ul>

    These skills are supported and enhanced by a number of dispositions or attitudes that are
    essential dimensions of CT. These dispositions or attitudes include:

    <ul>
        <li>Confidence in dealing with complexity</li>
        <li>Persistence in working with difficult problems</li>
        <li>Tolerance for ambiguity</li>
        <li>The ability to deal with open ended problems</li>
        <li>The ability to communicate and work with others to achieve a common goal or solution</li>
    </ul>
