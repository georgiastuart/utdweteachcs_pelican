    <h3>Discussion Part 2</h3>
    <p class="lead">Part 2 Ends on Sunday, March 26th at 11:59 pm</p>
    There was a lot of great discussion this week! I noticed three major concerns:
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty implementing extra stuff into an already packed curriculum</li>
        <li>Concerns of the feasibility across student abilities (either to difficult or too simplistic)</li>
        <li>Technology limitations</li>
    </ul>
    With that in mind, <span style="font-weight: bold">part 2 of the discussion</span> is a more general discussion on
    implementing new tools in your classroom. Please answer at least one of the following:
    <ol>
        <li>How much "teaching the tool" time do you find acceptable for integrating a new technology or instructional
            technique into your classroom? Does this change depending on time of year?
        </li>
        <li>What are some strategies you use to teach to a broad spectrum of abilities (not just for tech, but for your
            subject as well)? Do you see a way this could be applied to new tech tools?
        </li>
    </ol>
