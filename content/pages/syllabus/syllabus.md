## Course Description

With the addition of the Computer Science track in the STEM Endorsement
and the requirement that districts offer Computer Science and make it available
to all students, computer science certified teachers are in high demand.
This course series is intended to prepare Texas teachers to take the 8–12
Computer Science Test (241) and teach computer science or integrate computer
science principles within their current math or science classroom. The two
courses cover everything outlined in the TExES Computer Science 241 standards
for Domain II - Program Design and Development and Domain III - Programming
Language Topics. In addition, we cover as much as possible of Domain IV -
Special Topics. We also focus on the TEKS for Computer Science I and II and
the standards for AP Computer Science Principles. This course is **not** effective
preparation for AP Computer Science A..


## Requirements

Students are expected to be comfortable using a computer and typing. Consistent
Internet access is required as much of the course is online. Students must
be comfortable with middle school level math, including basic algebraic
manipulation and the coordinate plane.


## Course Format

Introduction to Computer Science for Teachers is a two-course series comprising
two eight week, three credit hour courses. Each course provides 45 contact
hours and is taught with a blended model—there is significant online instruction
and interaction. In addition, attendance at one of the two in-person sessions per
week is required (though you are welcome to attend both to receive more in-person assistance).


## Course Tools

We use TI-Nspire Handhelds, teacher software, and Innovator Hubs to explore
programming through TI-Basic and Lua and computers to write Lua and JavaScript.
Course communication and discussion will be done through the course Slack.
Note: you are not required to use your real name on Slack, but you must inform
the instructor of your screen name. All grades will be posted on the university eLearning.
