# Operations and Truth Values

In this section we'll discuss

1. Variable assignment (assignment operator)
2. Math operators
3. Truth values and comparison operators

## Variable assignment

In the previous section, we created
*variables*{: class="definition" },
but didn't yet assign any information to them! To set a variable to a value,
we use an
*assignment operator*{: class="definition" }.

In Scratch and block-based Trinkets, the assignment operator is its own
block.

on the arrow key pressed.
