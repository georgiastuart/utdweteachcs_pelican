# Introduction to Trinket

[Trinket.io](https://trinket.io) lets you write and execute code in your browser (including on

extra info). This week, we're using the block-based Python interface.

## How to use Trinket

The following video will demonstrate how to use Trinket, setup Trinket projects (Trinkets), or
modify and share existing trinkets. If you would like to follow along without creating an account,
there is a Trinket you can modify below the video.
