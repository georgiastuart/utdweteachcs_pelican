# Introduce yourself!

When you receive the slack invitation email, create your log in and
join the conversations! Slack is a communication platform that lets you
communicate with your classmates and the instructors in real-time.

You can access Slack from a computer browser, a desktop application for
Windows or Mac, or a mobile app for iOS or Android. [Here is a good guide
for getting started with Slack!](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users)

Slack will be our **primary communication platform** for discussions and
asking questions. If you have any trouble or want some help, let us know!
