# Variables

A
*variable*{: class="definition" }
in programming is how we can store and reference information.
They're similar to variables in math, except they can store many different
types of information instead of just mathematical objects. You can *assign*
information to a variable in one place, and then use that variable in another
to retrieve that information.

A variable consists of two parts: a name (called the
*identifier*{: class="definition" }
) and the information (called the
*value*{: class="definition" }
).

## Types of Information

There are many types of information in programming. This week we focus
on using *numbers*—like 1, 2.5, 3.99, -1, etc—and *text*, like "Hello World".

Later in the course we'll refine what we mean by *numbers* and *text*.
