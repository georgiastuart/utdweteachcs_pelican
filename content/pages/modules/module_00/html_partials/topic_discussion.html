    <h3>Discussion Part 1</h3>
    <p class="lead">Part 1 Ends on March 15th at 11:59 pm</p>
    In the #module-0-discussion channel, discuss the value (or lack thereof if that's how you feel!) of computational thinking
    within the subject you currently teach. You might consider how it might enhance (or detract from) certain
    methods in your subject, or how it could be used to further support student learning.
