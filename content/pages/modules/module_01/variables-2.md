# Variable assignment

In the previous section, we created
*variables*{: class="definition" },
but didn't yet assign any information to them! To set a variable to a value,
we use an
*assignment operator*{: class="definition" }.

In Scratch and block-based Trinkets, the assignment operator is its own
block.

## Variable Assignment in Trinket

### You try!

Complete the code by setting **x_max**, **x_min**, **y_max**, and **y_min**
to appropriate

## Asking for User Input

One way to assign a variable is to ask your user to input the value. This
can give a program a layer of interactivity!
