# Course Format

Every week, you will receive new content and assignments online on this
website! Modules will become available on the Wednesday prior to their "week."

## Weekly expectations

In addition to the general attendance and participation policy laid out
in the [syllabus](/syllabus), every week your work will consist of the following items.

1. Participate in the weekly discussion topic channel on Slack. The topic will vary each week. The discussion will happen in two parts: the first part will be the initial question, which you must engage with by Wednesday at 11:59 pm. Thursday morning, a follow up prompt will be posted, which you must engage with by Sunday at 11:59 pm.
2. **(Optional, but highly encouraged)** ask questions about the week’s content on Slack, and engage with other students about the content. The instructional team will monitor Slack frequently to respond to questions and requests.
3. Complete the online lectures and comprehension checks.
4. Attend class at least once. In-class sessions will be composed of hands-on lab activities, “offline” programming activities, and anything else that does not come across well online. We will also include time to work on assignments with the assistance of the instructional team. While the general content and lab will be the same on both Monday and Thursday, you are more than welcome to attend both classes. If you do, you can either participate in the activities again, or you may simply work on your assignments with the support of the instructional team.
5. Complete the weekly mini-project or assignments. This may be individual, in pairs, or in small teams, depending on the week.
6. Complete the weekly reflection and check in. This is quick and is intended for us to see where you are and how you’re feeling!

## Week format and timing

Each weel will follow the same format and timing (with exception of the first week,
see [the next section](#firstweek). The [calendar](/calendar)
has the most detailed and up-to-date information.

## The first week # {#firstweek}

UT Dallas has Spring Break the second week of our class. Since the first week is odd anyway and I’m sure there will be technology kinks to work out, the first-week assignments will extend over the second week. All assignments and discussions given the first week will have the following due dates:

- Discussion part 1 will be due on Wed, March 15 at 11:59 pm
- Assignments will be due Sun, March 19 at 11:59 pm



We will not have official class the week of the 13th. However, I will be available in the classroom at the usual class times. You are welcome to come for in-person help during class time.

Materials for week 3 will be posted on **Wed, March 15** and the semester will continue on the planned pattern.
